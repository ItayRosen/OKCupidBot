# OKCupidBot
Bot for liking &amp; sending intros

# How it works
Given an intro message to send and number of profiles to work on, the bot enters profiles from the DoubleTake, likes them and sends the message which you provided as an intro. Returns to the DoubleTake and repeats.

# Usage
* Open the browser and navigate to the DoubleTake page
* Copy the script from `script.js`
* Edit the number of profiles to like & the message to send
* Paste the edited script in the console and hit enter.
* Sit back and watch the bot in action!
